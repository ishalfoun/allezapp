-had to change the firebase.json fle:

setup firebase db + auth + hosting
plan:
[x] -set up firebase db
[x]-create each file for {user/profile/Navbar}
[x]	-login + st
	
-----------------

[todo]
[x] -so new routes adding works
[x] -old routes deleting works
[x] -make the profileroutes init with the profile
[x] -pRs also include rating and route
[x] 	-test by creating new routes and sync

[x]  profile needs last-updated field
[x]		-this is set when getRoutes succeeds
[x]  input: table called 'last-update'
[x] 	- when I add a route, last-update
		  gets filled in with 19.3.2020 6:32
[x]  check:
		-when logging in, compared last-u
		-if same do nothing
		-if diff: sync.
[x] Input Mode:
[x]	(pictured)
	-back, clear, enter/New, enter/Next


publish:
-make a new page, here all changes are compiled
[x] Publish.vue
	-all additions i made
	-all deletions i made
	-(check each routeNum and Rating to see diffs)
	-commit button
		-this will save changes to routes_real
		-update the old file to get things from routes_real
[x] what if i duplicated a route by accident.
[x] what if they replace a route by the same rating..... and it doesnt show on either addition or removal


-maybe we dont need the whole big if statements
	- just get all literal additions
	- and get all literal deletions
	- and show.
	-if i overwrite, its my bad and will be a new route.
		-thats why i must check what i delete and add.
		-if add and rem show same
			-then i decide:
				if replaced: leave it as is
				if my mistake: undo both.
				
    // old:
    // 1 - loop through routes
    // 2 - if it doesnt exist in routesReal, = an addition i made
    // 3 - if it exists, check if it is at it's own first found index
    //   - if not, it is a duplicate.
    //    -check how often it exists.
    //      -if twice
    //        -check if routesReal also has it twice....
    //          - if more than twice = a deletion I made +(flag it)
    //          - if less = an addition I made +(flag it for del)
    //          - if yes = do nothing.
    // 4 - loop through routesReal
    // 5 - if it doesnt exist in routes, = a removal i made
    // 6 - if it exists, check if it is at it's own first found index (dupe)
    // 7 -  if not, its a dupe that is now single = a removal i made

[plan]
[x] additions:
	-check by id (routes:routesReal)
[x] del 
	-check by id (routes:routesReal)
[x] disply with indiv del btn
[x] have a final commit button:
	-commits myroutes:
		-adds all additi./del all del's
		-to routesReal
	-make sure both are in sync
		-then clear add/del's
		
if hey dont have it for 2019
or i have to make a anonymous.


[problems now:]
